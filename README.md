# Call a Phone Number From Your Android App Using Sinch

In this tutorial, you will build an Android app that uses Sinch to call phone numbers all over the world. It will take about 15 minutes.

You can find the finished code for this tutorial at [github.com/sinch/android-pstn-tutorial](https://github.com/sinch/android-pstn-tutorial).

##Setup
To get started, create a blank project in Android Studio or Eclipse. You only need one activity for this app; I'll call mine **CallActivity**.

To use the Sinch SDK, you will need to create a developer account. If you don't have one yet, sign up [here](http://www.sinch.com/signup). Once inside the developer dashboard, you can create a new app by clicking **Apps**>**Create new app**, and filling in an app name.

Once you've created your app, you will see your app key and secret in the dashboard. Write these down because you will need these in a few minutes. 

To download a copy of the latest version of the Sinch Android SDK, head over to [sinch.com/downloads](https://www.sinch.com/downloads/). Once you've downloaded the SDK, follow these instructions to include it in your project:

**Android Studio**  
<ol>
<li>Copy the entire libs folder to your projectâ€™s app folder</li>
	<li>Open build.gradle (Module) in allprojects  >  repositories , add these lines
		
               flatDir {
                   dirs '/libs'
		       }
  
</li>
	<li>Finally, open build.gradle (Project) in dependencies and add this line:

          compile(name:'sinch-android-rtc', version:'+', ext:'aar')

</li>  
</ol>

##Create the view
The view for this app is very simple. It will be a single button that functions as both the **call** and **hang-up** button. There will also be a TextView that shows the state of the call (ringing or connected, for example).

<img src="images/view.png"/>

	<Button
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Call"
        android:id="@+id/callButton"
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
        android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"/>

	<TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text=""
        android:id="@+id/callState"
        android:layout_below="@+id/callButton"
        android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"/>
        
By default, the button will act as a call button and the call state will be empty.


##Permissions to make a phone call
To make a phone call, you will need a few app permissions, as well access to the hardware microphone. Add this in **AndroidManifest.xml**:

    <uses-feature
        android:name="android.hardware.microphone"
        android:required="false"/>

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

##Make the call
To make a call with Sinch (from **CallActivity**), the first thing you will need is an instance of the Sinch client, with the app key and secret you created earlier in this tutorial:

    //in onCreate
    final SinchClient sinchClient = Sinch.getSinchClientBuilder()
        .context(this)
        .userId("current-user-id")
        .applicationKey("your-app-key")
        .applicationSecret("your-app-secret")
        .environmentHost("sandbox.sinch.com")
        .build();

        sinchClient.setSupportCalling(true);
        sinchClient.start();
        
Note: In a production app, you wouldn't want to hardcode a single user ID into this. Instead, you would use a string that uniquely identifies the current user in your app.

Next, define the callButton and callState from the view:

    callState = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.callState);
    callButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.callButton);
    
Then, listen for a click on the call button:

    callButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View view) {
            //make a call!
        }
    });
    
When the button is clicked, you will make a call to our test phone number. Calling the test phone number is an easy way to test your app. (You can also easily swap out the test phone number for any phone number and give it a call.)

````
sinchClient.getCallClient().callPhoneNumber("+46000000000");
callButton.setText("Hang Up");
````

At this point, you can use your app to make a test call. Kill the app to hang up; you will add the functionality to hang up in the next section.

##Hang up the call
The first thing you need to do is keep track of the current call. Declare a variable, call and store the current call in this:

````
Call call;
    
//when calling
call = sinchClient.getCallClient().callPhoneNumber("+46000000000");
````
    
This way, you can check to see if there is a current call in the OnClickListener and respond appropriately:

    callButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View view) {
            if (call == null) {
                call = sinchClient.getCallClient().callPhoneNumber("+46000000000");
                callButton.setText("Hang Up");
            } else {
                call.hangup();
            }
        }
    });
    
##Add a call listener
A call listener makes it easy to respond to events throughout the call, such as setting the callState text to "ringing" when the call is trying to connect or letting the user control the volume of the voice stream when the call is connected. See the inline comments below for more explanation:

    private class SinchCallListener implements CallListener {
        
        //the call is ended for any reason
        @Override
        public void onCallEnded(Call endedCall) {
            call = null; //no longer a current call
            callButton.setText("Call"); //change text on button
            callState.setText(""); //empty call state
            //hardware volume buttons should revert to their normal function
            setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.USE_DEFAULT_STREAM_TYPE);
        }

        //call is connected
        @Override
        public void onCallEstablished(Call establishedCall) {
            //change the call state in the view
            callState.setText("connected");
            //the hardware volume buttons should control the voice stream volume
            setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_VOICE_CALL);
        }

        //call is trying to connect
        @Override
        public void onCallProgressing(Call progressingCall) {
            //set call state to "ringing" in the view
            callState.setText("ringing");
        }

        @Override
        public void onShouldSendPushNotification(Call call, List<PushPair> pushPairs) {
            //intentionally left empty
        }
    }
    
Last but not least, add an instance of the SinchCallListener to the call right after it is created:

`call.addCallListener(new SinchCallListener());`
    
Congratulations on completing this tutorial! You can now call any phone number from your Android app using Sinch.
